# Traffic Vision

This is a project for SIH-2020 

## Problem Statement :

<p>The objective is to develop a smart intelligent traffic signal system based on various image 
processing and artificial intelligence techniques to collect the real time traffic data 
and monitor accordingly to avoid big jams and accidents.Use inputs from tools like Google maps and 
design an app that can be installed on devices to track and report such traffic jams. 
Ensure appropriate trust mechanisms are enabled to trust an reported incident of traffic jam 
depending on number of inputs.Provide verification mechanisms to ensure that it can be verified
by other users on the same route.</p>
